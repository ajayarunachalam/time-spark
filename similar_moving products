# Lets say we have a product 1234 with levels [70,120,120,90,20,20,80] over the week. 

If the percentage change is calculated as the movement of levels from 70 to 60 i.e., -14%. It won't give us any information about the changes that happened during the week.

# If we calculate by aggregating the percentage change per day over the week we get a better estimate.

start   end   %change
---------------------
 70  -  120 : +71%
 120 -	120 :   0%
 120 -   90 : -25%
 90  -   20 : -77%
 20  -   20 :   0%
 20  -   60 : +300%
--------------------
Average % increase		: +53%
Average % decrease		: -15%
--------------------------------

# If the level on Day1 was 0 and the Day2 was any other number, say 4. The percentage change is undefined (infinity). 
So the relative percentage change is not the best metric to find movement. But can be used as a feature for predicting levels. 

# I think the rate of change in SKU is a better metric for movement. 
The avg rate of decrease of the above SKU is 14 units/day. The avg rate at which it is replenished is 15 units/day with an average inventory level of 73 units/day. This can show how fast the product moves and how big its level is.

# It is also possible to fit a polynomial function through this points. The derivative will give us the rate, but it is computationally expensive and won't give us any better results. 

# I have attached an image showing the levels of top_100_moving_products over 30days period. (file: topMoving_100Sku.png) 
Just by looking at the plot, we can say that some products increases in every 2 days, some on every 3 days and most on every 5 days. 
We can run a clustering algorithm to find similar moving products.

One more interesting thing is the whenever there is an increase in the levels most of the time there is a decrease at the same rate. This may be because they fill the inventory only after getting the request from the customer or knowing the demand.

The count of the number of hype (frequency) and its magnitude (level) can indicate the demand of that SKU. Further we can find the time taken for the hype to hit the average level (hype-time).  

# We can build a predictive model starting with these features:
Cluster_group, Rate, Level, %change, frequency, hype-time and each of their statistical features: ( stdev, mean, median, mode etc,.) taken over the time window of a day, two days, a month, 3 months and historic whether data.
